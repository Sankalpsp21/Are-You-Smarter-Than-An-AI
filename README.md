### TODO

- [ ] Landing Page: Sign in, Sign up
- [x] **Fix Redux** (Idk whay but the returned value is **always undefined** for now)
- [ ] Handling LOSE case; when a random player is just eliminated, then that player will see the LOSE message page while the other players will navigate to Lobby page. (Vote page)
- [ ] Overall Styling (The lowest priority)

- I think I finished all requirements from our Figma. So, if the subscription works properly, then Message & Result pages are done. (Imgyeong Lee)
